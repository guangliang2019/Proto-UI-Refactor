## 0. Scope & Audience

### 0.1 Audience

This contract is **normative** for:

- Component Authors (Prototype authors)
- Runtime maintainers (engine)
- Adapter authors (as a reference for exposed guarantees)

### 0.2 Scope (v0)

This document specifies:

- Lifecycle callback ordering
- Visibility boundaries (what is available when)
- Interaction with:
  - state
  - render / commit
  - update scheduling
  - unmount & disposal

### 0.3 Non-goals (v0)

This document does **NOT** specify:

- Adapter internal lifecycles (DOM / framework specifics)
- Event registration semantics (see `event.v0.md`)
- Hook installation mechanics
- Error recovery or retry semantics

---

## 1. Canonical Lifecycle Timeline (v0)

Proto UI defines **one canonical lifecycle timeline** per component instance.

All hosts and adapters MUST map their behavior into this timeline
without reordering checkpoints.

### 1.1 Timeline overview

```

┌────────┐
│ setup  │   (prototype setup)
└───┬────┘
│
▼
┌──────────┐
│ created  │   (instance created, before first render)
└───┬──────┘
│
▼
┌──────────┐
│ render   │   (render function executed)
└───┬──────┘
│
▼
┌──────────┐
│ commit   │   (host applies rendered output)
└───┬──────┘
│
▼
┌──────────┐
│ mounted  │   (instance is reachable / interactive)
└──────────┘

```

After `mounted`, the instance may undergo zero or more **update cycles**,
and eventually:

```

┌────────────┐
│ unmounted  │   (instance is being torn down)
└────────────┘

```

---

## 2. Setup Phase

### 2.1 Definition

`setup(def)` is executed exactly once per component instance,
before any runtime behavior exists.

### 2.2 Guarantees

During `setup`:

- `def` is available
- No `run` handle exists
- No rendering has occurred
- No side effects may reach the host

### 2.3 Allowed operations (non-exhaustive)

- `def.state.*` (state slot definition)
- `def.event.on / onGlobal / off`
- `def.lifecycle.onCreated / onMounted / onUnmounted`
- returning the render function

### 2.4 Forbidden operations

During `setup`, implementations MUST throw if:

- runtime-only APIs are invoked (e.g. `state.set`)
- host-dependent capabilities are accessed
- `run`-bound APIs are used

> Enforcement is provided by SystemCaps / exec-phase guard.

---

## 3. Created Callback

### 3.1 Definition

The `created` callback runs **after setup** and **before the first render**.

It represents the moment where:

- the instance exists
- state storage exists
- but no DOM / host output has been committed

### 3.2 Ordering guarantee (normative)

- `created` MUST run **after** `setup`
- `created` MUST run **before** the first `render`
- `created` MUST run **before** the first `commit`

### 3.3 Capabilities during `created`

During `created`:

- `run` is available
- state `get()` and `set()` are allowed
- event callbacks are NOT yet active
- host output is NOT yet visible

### 3.4 State visibility rule (normative)

If a state mutation (`set`) occurs during `created`:

- the mutation MUST be visible to the initial render
- the initial render MUST observe the updated state

This is a hard guarantee in v0.

---

## 4. Render Phase

### 4.1 Definition

The render function returned from `setup` is executed to produce
a **rendered description** (children / template result).

### 4.2 Ordering guarantee

- The first render occurs **after** `created`
- The first render occurs **before** `mounted`

### 4.3 Capabilities during render

During render:

- `run` is available
- state `get()` is allowed
- state `set()` is allowed (but see §6.2)
- no implicit scheduling occurs

### 4.4 Render purity (normative, v0)

Proto UI v0 does **NOT** enforce render purity.

However:

- state mutations during render MUST NOT trigger an automatic re-render
- render execution is synchronous and single-pass

---

## 5. Commit

### 5.1 Definition

`commit` is the host-level application of the rendered output.

Examples:

- DOM insertion / patching (Web)
- framework reconciliation (React / Vue adapters)

### 5.2 Ordering guarantee

- `commit` MUST occur after render
- `mounted` MUST occur after commit

### 5.3 Visibility

After `commit`:

- rendered output is visible to the host
- event bindings MAY become effective (adapter-defined, see adapter contract)

---

## 6. Mounted Callback

### 6.1 Definition

`mounted` indicates that the component instance is now:

- reachable
- interactive
- fully connected to the host

### 6.2 Ordering guarantee (normative)

- `mounted` MUST run **after** the first `commit`
- `mounted` MUST NOT run if the instance is unmounted before commit completes

### 6.3 Capabilities during `mounted`

During `mounted`:

- `run` is available
- state `get()` and `set()` are allowed
- event callbacks MAY now fire
- side effects targeting the host are allowed

### 6.4 No implicit update rule (normative)

If state is mutated during `mounted`:

- the mutation MUST NOT trigger a render or commit automatically
- a new render requires an explicit `update()` call

---

## 7. Update Cycle (v0)

### 7.1 Trigger

An update cycle is triggered only by:

- an explicit `controller.update()` call
- host-controlled update wiring (adapter-defined)

State mutation alone MUST NOT trigger update.

### 7.2 Ordering

For each update cycle:

```

render → commit → updated callbacks (if any, future versions)

```

v0 does not define an `updated` lifecycle callback.

---

## 8. Unmounted Callback & Disposal

### 8.1 Definition

`unmounted` is invoked when the component instance is being torn down.

### 8.2 Ordering guarantee

- `unmounted` MUST run at most once
- `unmounted` MUST run before instance disposal
- `unmounted` MAY run even if `mounted` never ran

### 8.3 Capabilities during `unmounted`

During `unmounted`:

- `run` is still available
- state handles are still usable
- event cleanup is in progress or imminent

### 8.4 After disposal (normative)

After `unmounted` completes and disposal finishes:

- all state handles MUST throw on access
- all runtime capabilities are invalid
- no further callbacks may run

---

## 9. Error & Interruption Semantics (v0)

### 9.1 Errors in setup

If `setup` throws:

- the instance MUST NOT proceed to `created`
- no render or commit may occur
- adapters MUST NOT partially mount the instance

### 9.2 Errors in runtime callbacks

If a runtime callback throws:

- behavior is adapter-defined
- the canonical timeline MUST NOT be reordered
- partial execution MUST NOT resurrect a disposed instance

(v0 does not define recovery semantics.)

---

## 10. Summary of Hard Guarantees (v0)

Component Authors may rely on:

1. `created` runs before first render
2. state mutations in `created` are visible to first render
3. no state mutation triggers implicit render
4. `mounted` runs only after commit
5. runtime capabilities are invalid after disposal
6. lifecycle ordering is invariant across adapters

Any violation of these is a **bug**.

---

## 11. Versioning Notes

- This document specifies **v0**
- Future versions may:
  - add checkpoints
  - add new callbacks
  - tighten render purity
- Existing ordering guarantees MUST remain intact
